Topic:- Train a light weight model to identify make and model of the cars.
Dataset - Car Images Dataset | Kaggle
Questions â€“
1) Find out the make and model that is most represented and the one that is least represented
class? Is there a class imbalance problem, how would you handle class imbalance if it were
to exist (2 marks)
2) Apply the image processing techniques and explain the benefits of those technique (2
marks)
3) Train a lightweight model, show train and validation loss curves, show steps taken to tune
hyper params (1 marks)
4) Determine metric to evaluate performance of the model. Report how the model is
performing on the metric (2 Marks)
5) Deploy (3 marks)
a. As a rest api endpoint
b. Mobil app model
